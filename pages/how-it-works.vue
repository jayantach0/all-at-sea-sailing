        After choosing to spend a week with All At Sea, we provide you with all
        the details of where to go and what to bring for a week onboard one of
        our yachts.

        On the day of arrival, in your destination of choice, your skipper will
        meet you at one of our set locations in the marina.
        <em>(All details will be clearly provided via email after booking)</em>.
        Then you are all set to spend an amazing week island hopping and
        discovering new bays on your own skippered yacht.
