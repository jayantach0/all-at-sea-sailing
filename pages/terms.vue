        <h4 class="u-color-primary">1. Making your booking</h4>

        <p>
          You can initiate a booking by telephoning us, sending an enquiry
          online at our website or by emailing us directly. We will then
          register your options on our booking system and send you an e-mail
          with confirmation details. You will have the chance to confirm your
          option(s) on and make the appropriate payment (see clause 2 below) by
          credit or debit card or by bank transfer. For all bookings, the party
          leader must be at least 18 and must be authorised to make the booking
          on the basis of these Booking Conditions by all persons named on the
          booking. The party leader is responsible for making all payments due
          to us. All correspondence will be sent to the party leader. Once we
          have received your confirmation and all appropriate payments (see
          clause 2 below), we will confirm your holiday by issuing a
          confirmation invoice. This invoice will be sent to the e-mail address
          registered on your secure client web page. Please check this invoice
          carefully as soon as you receive it. Contact us immediately if any
          information which appears on the confirmation or any other document
          appears to be incorrect or incomplete as it may not be possible to
          make changes later. We regret we cannot accept any liability if we are
          not notified of any inaccuracies in any document within ten days of
          our sending it out.
        </p>

        <h4 class="u-color-primary">2. Payment</h4>

        <p>
          In order to confirm your chosen travel arrangements, a deposit of
          £1000 per boat (or full payment if booking within 10 weeks of
          departure) must be paid at the time of booking. If we do not receive
          all payments due (including any surcharge where applicable) in full
          and on time, we are entitled to assume that you wish to cancel your
          booking. In this case cancellation charges may be payable – see clause
          6.
        </p>

        <h4 class="u-color-primary">3. Your contract</h4>

        <p>
          A binding contract between us comes into existence when we despatch
          our confirmation invoice to the party leader. We both agree that
          English Law will apply to your contract and to all matters arising out
          of it (except as set out below). We both also agree that any dispute,
          claim or other matter of any description which arises between us must
          be dealt with the Courts of England and Wales only unless, in the case
          of Court proceedings, you live in Scotland or Northern Ireland. In
          this case, proceedings must either be brought in the Courts of your
          home country or those of England and Wales. If proceedings are brought
          in Scotland or Northern Ireland, you may choose to have your contract
          and any dispute, claim or other matter of any description which arises
          between us governed by the law of Scotland/Northern Ireland as
          applicable (but if you do not so choose, English law will apply).
          Changes to these Booking Conditions or the General Information shown
          in our website and brochure will only be valid if agreed by us.
        </p>

        <h4 class="u-color-primary">4. The cost of your travel arrangements</h4>

        <p>
          We reserve the right to make changes to and correct errors in
          advertised prices at any time before your travel arrangements are
          confirmed. We will advise you of any error of which we are aware and
          of the then applicable price at the time of booking. Please note,
          changes and errors occasionally occur. You must check the price of
          your chosen travel arrangements at the time of booking.
        </p>

        <h4 class="u-color-primary">5. Changes by you</h4>

        <p>
          Should you wish to make any changes to your confirmed holiday
          arrangements, you must notify us in writing as soon as possible.
          Whilst we will endeavour to assist, we cannot guarantee we will be
          able to meet any such requests. Where we can, an amendment fee of £15
          per person/per booking will be payable together with any costs
          incurred by ourselves and any costs or charges incurred or imposed by
          any of our suppliers.
        </p>

        <h4 class="u-color-primary">6. Cancellation by you</h4>

        <p>
          Must be confirmed in writing to the Company by the Charterer (i.e. the
          lead name) together with the return of any valid travel documents.
          These must be received by the Company prior to the departure date. The
          date on which the Company receives written cancellation will be the
          date used to determine cancellation charges. If the cancellation is
          made 45 or more days before the departure date, the Company reserves
          the right to keep 50% of the charter amount, and if the cancellation
          is made within 45 days before the departure date, the Company reserves
          the right to make no refund of the total amount.
        </p>

        <h4 class="u-color-primary">7. Insurance</h4>

        <p>
          The Company requires that all clients take out personal travel/holiday
          insurance to cover the client for all medical, loss and cancellation.
          The Company will not be held liable for loss or damage suffered by the
          client whether insured or uninsured.
        </p>

        <h4 class="u-color-primary">8. Changes and cancellation by us</h4>

        <p>
          We start planning the charter arrangements we offer many months in
          advance. Occasionally, we have to make changes to and correct errors
          in website and other details both before and after bookings have been
          confirmed and cancel confirmed bookings. Whilst we always endeavour to
          avoid changes and cancellations, we must reserve the right to do so.
          Most changes are minor. Occasionally, we have to make a “significant
          change”. A significant change is a change made before the date that
          your arrangements with us are due to commence which, taking account of
          the information you give us at the time of booking and which we can
          reasonably be expected to know as a tour operator, we can reasonably
          expect to have a major affect on your travel arrangements. Significant
          changes are likely to include the following changes when made before
          the date on which the travel arrangements you have booked with us are
          due to commence; a change of accommodation to that of a lower official
          classification or standard for the whole or a major part of the time
          you are away, a change of accommodation area for the whole or a major
          part of the time you are away, and, in the case of tours, a
          significant change of itinerary missing out one or more major
          destination substantially or altogether*.
        </p>

        <h4 class="u-color-primary">9. Force Majeure</h4>

        <p>
          Except where otherwise expressly stated in these booking conditions,
          we regret we cannot accept liability or pay any compensation where the
          performance or prompt performance of our obligations under our
          contract with you is prevented or affected by or you otherwise suffer
          any damage or loss (as more fully described in clause 10(1) below) as
          a result of “force majeure”. In these Booking Conditions, “force
          majeure” means any event which we or the supplier of the service(s) in
          question could not, even with all due care, foresee or avoid. Such
          events may include war or threat of war, riot, civil strife, actual or
          threatened terrorist activity, industrial dispute, natural or nuclear
          disaster, adverse weather conditions, fire and all similar events
          outside our control.
        </p>

        <h4 class="u-color-primary">10. Our Liability to you</h4>

        <p>
          (1) We promise to make sure that the travel arrangements we have
          agreed to make, perform or provide as applicable as part of our
          contract with you are made, performed or provided with reasonable
          skill and care. This means that, subject to these booking conditions,
          we will accept responsibility if, for example, you suffer death or
          personal injury or your contracted travel arrangements are not
          provided as promised or prove deficient as a result of the failure of
          ourselves, our employees, agents or suppliers to use reasonable skill
          and care in making, performing or providing, as applicable, your
          contracted travel arrangements. Please note it is your responsibility
          to show that reasonable skill and care has not been used if you wish
          to make a claim against us. In addition, we will only be responsible
          for what our employees, agents and suppliers do or do not do if they
          were at the time acting within the course of their employment (for
          employees) or carrying out work we had asked them to do (for agents
          and suppliers). (2) We will not be responsible for any injury,
          illness, death, loss (for example loss of enjoyment), damage, expense,
          cost or other sum or claim of any description whatsoever which results
          from any of the following: the act(s) and/or omission(s) of the
          person(s) affected or any member(s) of their party or the act(s)
          and/or omission(s) of a third party not connected with the provision
          of your holiday and which were unforeseeable or unavoidable or ‘force
          majeure’ as defined in clause 9 above (3) Please note, we cannot
          accept responsibility for any services which do not form part of our
          contract. This includes, for example, any additional services or
          facilities which your hotel or any other supplier agrees to provide
          for you where the services or facilities are not advertised on our
          website and we have not agreed to arrange them and any excursion you
          purchase in resort. Please also see clause 15 “Excursions Activities
          and Website Information”. In addition, regardless of any wording used
          by us on our website, in any of our brochures or elsewhere, we only
          promise to use reasonable skill and care as set out above and we do
          not have any greater or different liability to you. (4) The promises
          we make to you about the services we have agreed to provide or arrange
          as part of our contract – and the laws and regulations of the country
          in which your claim or complaint occurred – will be used as the basis
          for deciding whether the services in question had been properly
          provided. If the particular services which gave rise to the claim or
          complaint complied with local laws and regulations applicable to those
          services at the time, the services will be treated as having been
          properly provided. This will be the case even if the services did not
          comply with the laws and regulations of the UK which would have
          applied had those services been provided in the UK. The exception to
          this is where the claim or complaint concerns the absence of a safety
          feature which might lead a reasonable holiday maker to refuse to take
          the travel arrangements in question. (5) As set out in these booking
          conditions we limit the maximum amount we may have to pay you for any
          claims you may make against us. Where we are found liable for loss of
          and/or damage to any luggage or personal possessions (including
          money), the maximum amount we will have to pay you is £1,000 per
          person affected unless a lower limitation applies to your claim under
          this clause or clause 10(6) below. For all other claims which do not
          involve death or personal injury, if we are found liable to you on any
          basis the maximum amount we will have to pay you is twice the price
          (excluding insurance premiums and amendment charges) paid by or on
          behalf of the person(s) affected in total unless a lower limitation
          applies to your claim under clause 10 (6) below. This maximum amount
          will only be payable where everything has gone wrong and you have not
          received any benefit at all from your travel arrangements. (6) Where
          any claim or part of a claim (including those involving death or
          personal injury) concerns or is based on any travel arrangements
          forming part of your contract with us (including the process of
          getting on and/or off the transport concerned) provided by any air,
          sea, rail or road carrier or any stay in a hotel, the maximum amount
          of compensation we will have to pay you will be limited. The most we
          will have to pay you for that claim or that part of a claim if we are
          found liable to you on any basis is the most the carrier or hotel
          keeper concerned would have to pay under the international convention
          or regulation which applies to the travel arrangements or hotel stay
          in question (for example the Athens convention for international
          travel by sea). Please note: Where a carrier or hotel would not be
          obliged to make any payment to you under the applicable International
          Convention or Regulation in respect of a claim or part of a claim, we
          similarly are not obliged to make a payment to you for that claim or
          part of the claim. When making any payment, we are entitled to deduct
          any money which you have received or are entitled to receive from the
          transport provider or hotelier for the complaint or claim in question.
          Copies of the applicable International Conventions and Regulations are
          available from us on request. (7) Please note, we cannot accept any
          liability for any damage, loss, expense or other sum(s) of any
          description (1) which on the basis of the information given to us by
          you concerning your booking prior to our accepting it, we could not
          have foreseen you would suffer or incur if we breached our contract
          with you or (2) which did not result from any breach of contract or
          other fault by ourselves or our employees or, where we are responsible
          for them, our suppliers. Additionally we cannot accept liability for
          any business losses. (8)You must provide ourselves and our insurers
          with all assistance we may reasonably require. You must also tell us
          and the supplier concerned about your claim or complaint as set out in
          clause 11 below. If asked to do so, you must transfer to us or our
          insurers any rights you have against the supplier or whoever else is
          responsible for your claim or complaint (if the person concerned is
          under 18, their parent or guardian must do so). You must also agree to
          cooperate fully with us and our insurers if we or our insurers want to
          enforce any rights which are transferred.
        </p>

        <h4 class="u-color-primary">11. Complaints and problems</h4>

        <p>
          In the unlikely event that you have any reason to complain or
          experience any problems with your holiday whilst away, you must
          immediately inform our representative and the supplier of the
          service(s) in question. Any verbal notification must be put in writing
          and given to our representative and the supplier as soon as possible
          and written in the complaints book located on the boat concerned.
          Until we know about a problem or complaint, we cannot begin to resolve
          it. Most problems can be dealt with quickly. If you remain
          dissatisfied, however, you must write to us within 28 days of your
          return to the UK giving your booking reference and full details of
          your complaint. Only the party leader should write to us. If you fail
          to follow this simple complaints procedure, your right to claim the
          compensation you may otherwise have been entitled to may be affected
          or even lost as a result.
